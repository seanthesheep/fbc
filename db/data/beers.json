    "description": "Fairhope No. 51 is a classic American pale ale, brewed with a combination of American-made Falconer's Flight hops and German hops. Named for being the 51st recipe entry into head brewer Dan's beer notebook, this pale ale is packed with hop flavor but not overly bitter. Though this crisp, flavorful beer was 51 in Dan's notebook, we expect it to be your top choice for a pale throughout Lower Alabama.",
